        <h1>Honda Civic</h1>
        <p>
          otally redesigned last year, the 2023 Honda Civic carries over largely
          unchanged. That’s no bad thing though because the reinvented Civic
          sits firmly at the top of its class. The handsome styling houses an
          interior so roomy it feels closer to midsize than compact, and its
          well-tuned chassis and engines make even the base model fun to drive.
          Honda also piles on safety features, although getting the choicest
          gear in other areas means upgrading to higher-spec models. Some rivals
          do better in individual areas, like fuel economy or acceleration, but
          the Civic is a jack of all trades and a master of most.

        <h1>Hyundai Elantra</h1>
        <p>
          The Elantra doesn’t dominate in any single area, but it does
          everything well and is undeniably value-packed. The Elantra stands
          near the top of its class in nearly every area, and dominates in
          several, like back seat room and fuel economy. Its overachieving
          interior is loaded with standard features and driver-assistance tech.
          And shoppers get a full range of models, including a fuel-sipping
          hybrid and a knockout Elantra N that may offer the most bang for the
          buck of any small performance car in today’s showrooms.

        <h1>Kia Forte</h1>
        <p>
          The Kia Forte turns six years old as it enters 2023 and without major
          changes to the compact sedan. That’s because it hasn’t needed much
          change, apart from its mid-cycle refresh in 2020. Despite its age, it
          continues withstanding the test of time by proving that big value can
          still come in small packages without too much compromise and at a
          reasonable cost, especially with steep inflation and supply chain
          issues still lingering. The top GT can perform (at a more than
          acceptable $25,000) and it’s one of the few sedans that still comes
          with a third pedal.
